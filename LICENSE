At Cumulus's request, Licensee will promptly provide such Records to Cumulus for the purpose of verifying compliance with this Agreement. In the event that Licensee fails to create, maintain or deliver Records as required under this Section or in the event of any dispute as to the accuracy of such Records, Cumulus may audit Licensee's use of the Product (e.g., via review of copies of applicable log files, etc.), at any location in which the Product is or has been installed or otherwise utilized by Licensee.
    	4. Delivery and Support.

    b.

Licensee grants Cumulus a limited license to use Licensee's Marks in accordance with Licensee's Marks usage guidelines for the sole purpose of identifying Licensee as a customer.  The parties will not otherwise use or register (or make any filing with respect to) the other party's Marks anywhere in the world.  Neither party will contest anywhere in the world the use by or authorization by the other party of any of such party's Marks.

   	6. Prohibition Against Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any rights, licenses or obligations hereunder, may be assigned by either party without the prior written approval of the non-assigning party; any prohibited purported assignment shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may assign this Agreement or delegate its rights and obligations to any acquirer of all or of substantially all of such party's assets or business or equity securities pertaining to the subject matter of this Agreement, provided however, that in the event of any such assignment, upon receipt of notice of assignment, the non-assigning party shall have a period of thirty days to terminate this Agreement upon written notice. 
   	7. Term of Agreement. The term of this Agreement shall run until expired as set forth in the last to expire valid electronic license file you receive from Cumulus or Cumulus's authorized reseller (the "Initial Term").  At the end of the then current Term, unless written notice of intention not to renew is delivered by one party to the other party on or before thirty (30) days before the end of the Term, the Agreement shall automatically renew for an additional one year term (each a "Renewal Term" and collectively with the "Initial Term" the "Term").  This Agreement may be terminated if either party materially fails to perform or comply with this Agreement or any material provision hereof. Termination shall be effective thirty (30) days after notice of termination to the defaulting party if the defaults have not been cured within such thirty (30) day period.  
    	8. Survival. Rights to payment, Sections 1, 2(b-e), 3(b), 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 (b-d), and 14 and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any right of action for breach of this Agreement prior to termination shall survive any termination of this Agreement.  In the event of termination for Cumulus's breach, all Purchased Licenses shall survive termination until the end of the applicable License Term.  In the event of termination for Licensee's breach, all Purchased Licenses shall immediately terminate. 
    	9. Notices and Requests. All notices, consents, authorizations, and requests in connection with this Agreement shall be deemed given immediately after they are sent by air express courier, charges prepaid; and addressed with Attention to the Legal Department to the applicable address set forth in the most recent Order Confirmation governed by this Agreement or to such other address as the party to receive the notice or request so designates by written notice under this Section 9 to the other.
    	10. Controlling Law; Attorney's Fees. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of California and the United States without regard to its conflicts of laws provisions and without regard to UCITA or the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.

Both parties consent to the jurisdiction and venue of such courts and agree that process may be served in the manner provided herein for giving of notices or otherwise as allowed by California or federal law.  The prevailing party in any dispute shall be entitled to recover its reasonable costs attorneys' fees, and other expenses. 
    	11. Confidentiality

Each party acknowledges that its breach of this Section 11 would cause irreparable injury to the other for which monetary damages are not an adequate remedy. Accordingly, a party will be entitled to seek injunctions and other equitable remedies in the event of such a breach by the other.
    	12. Limited Liability. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED BELOW, AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE IN THIS AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE OR OBLIGATED UNDER ANY SECTION OF THIS AGREEMENT OR UNDER CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (A) FOR ANY AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE AGGREGATE OF THE LICENSE FEES PAID TO IT (IN THE CASE OF CUMULUS) OR (IN THE CASE OF LICENSEE) PAID OR OWED BY IT HEREUNDER, OR (B) ANY INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS (EXCEPT AMOUNTS PAYABLE UNDER SECTION 3) OR LOST OR CORRUPTED DATA OR INTERRUPTED USE OR (C) COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS, TECHNOLOGY OR SERVICES. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 12 SHALL NOT APPLY TO BREACHES OF SECTIONS 2(b-e) AND 11 OR TO ACTIONS OF LICENSEE BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THE LICENSE GRANT HEREUNDER.

    c. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH ABOVE, CUMULUS MAKES NO WARRANTIES TO ANY PERSON OR ENTITY WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCT AND DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
    d.
